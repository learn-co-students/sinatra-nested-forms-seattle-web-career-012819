<h1>Welcome to the Nested Forms Lab!</h1>

<p>In this lab, you'll practice using nested forms in Sinatra. As a convenience, I've added the instructions from the README below:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Make a nested form (this should probably have html <label>s so it makes sense to a user). This form will be creating three objects (one instance of the Pirate class, and two instances of the Ship class). Remember, you'll need to build a corresponding controller action to load this page. Your form should POST to the route '/pirates'.</li>

  <li>After a user clicks submit they should be taken to a page that displays all the information we just posted from the form. You should have a page that shows the pirate you created along with their ships and all the details about the pirate and their ships.</li>

  <li>Pass the tests! You'll notice in specs that we use Capybara to fill in certain fields.</li>

  <li>The word in quotes after fill_in needs to be set as an ID in the form. This is because your ship name one and two will have the same name property. Capybara needs some sort of unique indentifier, so we use id. </li>

</ul>
